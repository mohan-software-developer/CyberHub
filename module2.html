                        <p>Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their
                            activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or
                            cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing
                            what the different types are and how they spread is key to containing and removing them.</p>

                            network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using
                            name-dropping techniques in order to gain

                    <p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry
                        out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network
                        service to users, devices or applications.<br><br><strong>Select the images to find out more

                    <p>A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple,
                        coordinated sources. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled
                            by handler systems.</li>
                        <li>The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more
                            zombies.</li>
                        <li>When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry
                            out a DDoS attack.</li>

                        or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are
                        typically controlled through a command and control server.<br><br>These bots can be activated to
                        distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks,
                        distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent
                        out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.<br><br>Many organizations. like Cisco,
                        force network activities through botnet

                            <p>Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. For example,
                                the type of memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component
                                which can hold an electrical charge) installed very
                                close to one another. However, it was soon discovered that, due to their close
                                proximity, changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor
                                capacitors. Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer
                                was created. By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit
                                triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the
                                RAM.</p>

                        <h5>Meltdown and Spectre</h5>
                        <p>Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities
                            that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released since 1995 within desktops,
                            laptops, servers, smartphones, smart devices
                            and cloud services.<br><br>Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities can read all memory
                            from a given system (Meltdown), as well as data handled by other applications (Spectre). The
                            Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability exploitations
                            are referred to as side-channel attacks (information is gained from the implementation of a
                            computer system). They have the ability to compromise large amounts of memory data because
                            the attacks can be run multiple times on
                            a system with very little possibility of a crash or other error.<br><br><br><br>Hardware
                            vulnerabilities are specific to device models and are not generally exploited through random
                            compromising attempts. While hardware exploits
                            are more common in highly targeted attacks, traditional malware protection and good physical
                            security are sufficient protection for the everyday user.</p>

                                                    from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has
                                                    access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it,

                                                    as read or change the file. Many security vulnerabilities are
                                                    created by the improper use of access controls.<br><br>Nearly all
                                                    access controls and security practices can be overcome if an
                                                    attacker has
                                                    physical access to target equipment. For example, no matter the
                                                    permission settings on a file, a hacker can bypass the operating
                                                    system and read the data directly off the disk. Therefore, to

                                                    the machine and the data it contains, physical access must be
                                                    restricted, and encryption techniques must be used to protect data

                            <p>The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of
                                vulnerabilities. Microsoft, Apple and other operating system producers release patches
                                and updates almost every day and applications such as web browsers,
                                mobile apps and web servers are often updated by the companies or organizations
                                responsible for them.<br><br>Despite the fact that organizations put a lot of effort
                                into finding and patching software vulnerabilities, new
                                vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. That’s why some organizations use third party
                                security researchers who specialize in finding vulnerabilities in software, or actually
                                invest in their own penetration testing teams
                                dedicated to search, find and patch software vulnerabilities before they can get
                                exploited.<br><br>Google’s Project Zero is a great example of this practice. After
                                discovering a number of vulnerabilities in various software
                                used by end users, Google formed a permanent team dedicated to finding software
                                vulnerabilities.<br><br></p>

                            <p>Cryptojacking is an emerging threat that hides on a user’s computer, mobile phone,
                                tablet, laptop or server, using that machine’s resources to 'mine’ cryptocurrencies
                                without the user's consent or knowledge.

                                <br><br>Many victims of cryptojacking didn’t even know they’d been hacked until it was
                                too late!
                            </p>
