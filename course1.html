                            from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

                            <br>Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or
                            read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information
                            online?
                            <br>Cybercriminals are certainly very imaginative when it comes to gaining access to your
                            money. But that’s not all they are after — they could also steal your identity and ruin your
                            life.

                        <p>Not content with stealing your money for short-term financial gain, cybercriminals are
                            invested in the long-term gain of identity theft.
                            <br>You took some photos at work on your mobile phone. Copies of these photos are now
                            available on your mobile device.

                            world.
                            <br>All of your friends downloaded the photos and now have copies of your photos on their

                            <br>One of your friends was so proud that they decided to post and share your photos online.
                            The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located
                            in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your
                            photos.

                        <p>It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data.
                            <br>Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to
                            advertisers for a profit.
                            In certain circumstances, ISPs may be legally required to share your information with
                            government surveillance agencies or authorities.
                            <br>Targeted advertising is part of the Internet experience. Advertisers monitor and track
                            your online activities such as shopping habits and personal preferences and send targeted
                            ads your way.
                            <br>Search engines and social media platforms: These platforms gather information about your
                            gender, geolocation, phone number and political and religious ideologies based on your
                            search histories and online identity. This information is then sold to advertisers for a
                            profit.
                            <br>Websites you visit: Websites use cookies to track your activities in order to provide a
                            more personalized experience. But this leaves a data trail that is linked to your online
                            identity that can often end up in the hands of advertisers!

                                    <p>IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other
                                        equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability
                                        to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through
                                        the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led
                                        to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology

                                organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all
                                of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The foundational principles for protecting information systems.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> is a set of rules that prevents sensitive
                                            information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and
                                            processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include data encryption,
                                            identity proofing and two factor authentication.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> ensures that system information or processes are
                                            protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure
                                            integrity is to use a hash function or checksum.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Availability</strong> means that authorized users are able to access

                                            established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by maintaining
                                            equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and
                                            software up to date, and creating backups.</li>
